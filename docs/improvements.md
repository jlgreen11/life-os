# Life OS — Improvements Backlog

This is the **grand master plan** for Life OS improvements. It is maintained
collaboratively between:

- The **parallel improvement orchestrator** (`scripts/run-parallel-improvement.sh`),
  which runs continuously on the Mac Mini server. Each wave, the planner agent
  reads this file, selects the top items from "Backlog", moves them to
  "In Progress", and spawns workers to implement them.
- **You** (or any other Claude session) — add ideas anytime by editing this file
  directly, committing, and pushing to `master`. The orchestrator will pick them
  up on the next wave (typically within 30–60 seconds of a wave ending).

## How to use this file

- Put higher-priority items at the **top** of "Backlog". The planner picks from
  the top down.
- Each item should have a **one-line summary**, a **category**, and a short
  **rationale** (why it matters). A few sentences of implementation hints are
  helpful but optional — the planner will expand them into concrete task specs.
- "In Progress" is owned by the orchestrator. Don't hand-edit it; the planner
  rewrites it every wave.
- "Completed" is an append-only log. Structured history also lives in
  `data/improvement-runs/state.json`.
- Humans can add items anywhere under "Backlog" or "Ideas". The planner will
  not delete human-authored items without explicit instruction.

## Backlog

_Prioritized list of improvements the planner should pick from. The agent will
seed this from codebase analysis on its first wave after this file was added.
Feel free to hand-add items above or below whatever the agent writes._

<!-- AGENT-MANAGED: the planner adds/removes items here each wave. Human edits
     are preserved as long as they follow the item format below. -->

- _(empty — will be populated on next wave)_

## In Progress

_Automatically updated each wave. Do not hand-edit unless a wave is stuck._

<!-- AGENT-MANAGED -->

- _(none)_

## Completed

_Append-only log of merged improvements. Most recent first._

<!-- AGENT-MANAGED: planner prepends completed items here. -->

- _(none yet)_

## Ideas

_Unsorted / half-baked thoughts. Humans: dump things here and the agent will
promote them to Backlog when it sees they're actionable. Agent: only promote
from Ideas → Backlog; do not delete._

- _(none)_
