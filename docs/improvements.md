# Life OS — Improvements Backlog

This is the **grand master plan** for Life OS improvements. It is maintained
collaboratively between:

- The **parallel improvement orchestrator** (`scripts/run-parallel-improvement.sh`),
  which runs continuously on the Mac Mini server. Each wave, the planner agent
  reads this file, selects the top items from "Backlog", moves them to
  "In Progress", and spawns workers to implement them.
- **You** (or any other Claude session) — add ideas anytime by editing this file
  directly, committing, and pushing to `master`. The orchestrator will pick them
  up on the next wave (typically within 30–60 seconds of a wave ending).

## How to use this file

- Put higher-priority items at the **top** of "Backlog". The planner picks from
  the top down.
- Each item should have a **one-line summary**, a **category**, and a short
  **rationale** (why it matters). A few sentences of implementation hints are
  helpful but optional — the planner will expand them into concrete task specs.
- "In Progress" is owned by the orchestrator. Don't hand-edit it; the planner
  rewrites it every wave.
- "Completed" is an append-only log. Structured history also lives in
  `data/improvement-runs/state.json`.
- Humans can add items anywhere under "Backlog" or "Ideas". The planner will
  not delete human-authored items without explicit instruction.

## Backlog

_Prioritized list of improvements the planner should pick from. The agent will
seed this from codebase analysis on its first wave after this file was added.
Feel free to hand-add items above or below whatever the agent writes._

<!-- AGENT-MANAGED: the planner adds/removes items here each wave. Human edits
     are preserved as long as they follow the item format below. -->

- **Add pre-write JSON serialization guard to topic extractor** · `broken_feature` — Returned from wave 9 (no PR created). Topics profile missing despite 13,519 qualifying events. Follow mood.py guard pattern.
- **Add pre-write JSON serialization guard to spatial extractor** · `broken_feature` — Returned from wave 9 (no PR created). Spatial profile missing despite 13,715 qualifying events. Two write sites need guards.
- **Add prediction pipeline health section to admin UI** · `missing_feature` — Returned from wave 9 (no PR created). Admin UI has no visibility into prediction generation, persistence, or dedup metrics.
- **Add regex-based task extraction fallback when AI engine is unavailable** · `missing_feature` — Open PR #724 awaiting merge. Returned from wave 8 (not merged).
- **Add diagnostic banner to dashboard when user model is empty** · `missing_feature` — Open PR #723 awaiting merge. Returned from wave 8 (not merged).
- **Fix temporal signal profile persistence failure (13,726 qualifying events, 0 profile)** · `broken_feature` — Open PR #700 awaiting merge. Temporal extractor writes fail silently; WAL resilience and retry needed.
- **Fix decision signal profile persistence and add fallback signal extraction** · `broken_feature` — Open PR #699 awaiting merge. Decision profile writes lost to WAL; needs write verification.
- **Add signal profile freshness check to insight engine data sufficiency report** · `missing_feature` — Open PR #701 awaiting merge. Adds freshness/staleness tracking per profile to get_data_sufficiency_report().
- **Fix missing error handling in /api/events, /api/rules, /api/contacts, /api/source-weights** · `code_quality` — Open PR #702 awaiting merge. Adds try/except guards and structured JSON 500 responses.
- **Reduce prediction deduplication waste with input-state fingerprinting** · `code_quality` — Returned from wave 8 (no PR created). 16x dedup ratio suggests predictions are being regenerated unnecessarily.
- **Add update_signal_profile() return value for caller-side failure detection** · `code_quality` — Currently returns void; callers can't distinguish success from silent failure. Requires coordinated changes across all extractors.
- **Add insight engine correlator execution tracking and failure logging** · `code_quality` — Individual correlator methods have no timing or success/failure metrics. No visibility into which correlators ran.

## Ideas

_Unsorted / half-baked thoughts. Humans: dump things here and the agent will
promote them to Backlog when it sees they're actionable. Agent: only promote
from Ideas → Backlog; do not delete._

- Update unused capability audit — CalDAV conflict detection is now fully implemented (connector.py:308-480) but audit still lists it as a stub.
- Linguistic outbound profile has only 11 qualifying events (email.sent/message.sent) — may need to wait for more outbound data or lower extraction thresholds.
